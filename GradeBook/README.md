# GradeBook - Frontend Service #2

This frontend service emulates a secondary platform which a teacher would typically need to login and submit grades for their students a second time. In our Demo, the User will no longer be required to login and manually input grades into this second platform, because we have engineered a solution that will automatically do this for them whenever they input a grade into the first platform.

## Public Endpoints

- `GET /grades`
- `POST /grades`
